Grid Size      = 1024.0
Cell Size      = 4.848136811095360e-06;
Frequency HZ   = 300000000.0
Speed of Light = 299792458.0

Wavelengths to Meters = Frequency HZ / Speed of Light

UV to Pixels = Grid Size * Cell Size

Dont forget right ascension (negative sign in front of u coordinate prior to wavelength scale)

UV Scale visibility coordinates during gridding to go from meters to pixels (multiplication)
